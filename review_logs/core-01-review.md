# MemoryHub Design Review Report (core-01-review)

**Review Date**: 2025-07-02  
**Reviewer**: architect-lead  
**Artifacts Reviewed**: docs/05-detailed-design.md §5.6, MemoryHub data model, API specifications  

## Executive Summary

✅ **APPROVED with minor refinements**

The MemoryHub design in docs/05-detailed-design.md demonstrates solid architectural foundation with clear separation of concerns and comprehensive API specification. The four-layer memory architecture aligns well with the project's goals of intelligent memory management for the Tianting development pipeline.

## Detailed Review Findings

### ✅ Strengths

1. **Clear API Surface**: The `LayeredMemoryManager` class provides intuitive methods (`remember`, `recall`, `stats`, `load_layer`) that map directly to user needs.

2. **Proper Data Modeling**: SQLite schema with `tasks`, `windows`, and `review_logs` tables provides appropriate relational structure for the use case.

3. **Scalability Considerations**: The layered approach (Core → Application → Archive) allows for efficient memory management as the system grows.

4. **Implementation-Ready**: API specifications include all necessary parameters and return types.

### ⚠️ Areas for Improvement

1. **Missing Layer Definitions**: The current design references a "four-layer memory architecture" but only clearly defines three layers (Core, Application, Archive). The fourth layer needs clarification.

2. **Memory Classification Logic**: The `_classify_memory()` private method is mentioned but lacks detailed specification of classification rules.

3. **Persistence Strategy**: While both SQLite and JSON persistence are mentioned, the decision criteria for choosing between them is not clearly defined.

4. **Error Handling**: No specification for error scenarios (e.g., database connection failures, corrupted JSON files).

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Pre-Implementation)

1. **Define Layer 4**: Clearly specify the fourth layer in the memory architecture (likely Session/Temporary layer).

2. **Classification Rules**: Document the logic for `_classify_memory()` - what content goes to which layer?

3. **Persistence Decision Tree**: Define when to use SQLite vs JSON persistence.

### Implementation Priorities

1. **Core-02a**: Start with in-memory skeleton to validate API design
2. **Core-02b**: Add SQLite persistence for tasks and metadata  
3. **Core-02c**: Implement JSON layer for full-text search and archival
4. **Core-02d**: Add statistics and benchmarking for performance monitoring

## Compliance Check

✅ **INVEST Criteria**:
- **Independent**: MemoryHub is decoupled from other components
- **Negotiable**: API surface can be refined based on usage patterns  
- **Valuable**: Provides clear value for memory management
- **Estimable**: Well-defined scope allows for accurate estimation
- **Small**: Can be implemented in 4 planned increments (02a-02d)
- **Testable**: Clear API contracts enable comprehensive testing

✅ **≤4h Deliverable**: Each sub-task (02a-02d) is appropriately scoped

## Verdict

**APPROVED** - Design is ready for implementation with the understanding that minor refinements will be made during the implementation phase based on the recommendations above.

## Next Steps

1. Update docs/05-detailed-design.md with clarifications from this review
2. Proceed with core-02a-memoryhub-skeleton implementation
3. Validate API design with concrete usage patterns
4. Iterate on design based on implementation feedback
